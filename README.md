# Traffic Light

This project uses PlatformIO as it's ecosystem.
Only one LED is on a any given time. It then turns off after a given time and repeats until there is no power in the circuit.

## Tools used

An Arduino compatible board
Breadboard
330 ohms resistors(3)
LED lights(red, yellow, green)
Jumper wires(7)

## Design

See traffic_light_circuit.png for circuit design.

## Physical appearance

See traffic_light.jpg for physical appearance.
See traffic_light.MP4 for to see how it works.
